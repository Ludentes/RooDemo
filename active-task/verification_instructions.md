# Triple-Gate Verification Instructions

## Gate 1: AI Self-Verification (Automated) âœ…

I've completed the following checks:
- Code compiles without errors
- Type checking passes
- No undefined variables or functions
- Required dependencies imported
- Basic logical consistency check
- Follows project formatting standards

## Gate 2: Human Verification (Manual)

To verify this implementation, please follow these steps:

### Run the Application
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
4. Open the application in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5173)

### Test the Core Functionality
- [ ] Verify the application loads without errors
- [ ] Check that the layout appears correctly with header and sidebar
- [ ] Test the sidebar toggle button in the header
- [ ] Verify that the dashboard displays mock data for elections and constituencies
- [ ] Check that the responsive layout works by resizing your browser window

### Review the Code Structure
- [ ] Examine the component structure in `frontend/src/components`
- [ ] Review the state management implementation in `frontend/src/store`
- [ ] Check that the styling is properly applied using Tailwind CSS 4
- [ ] Verify that shadcn/ui components are correctly integrated

Once you've completed these verification steps, please type "verified" to confirm that you've personally tested the implementation.

## Gate 3: Understanding Validation (Quiz)

After verification, please answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the implementation:

1. Explain the key technical decisions made in the frontend infrastructure and why they were chosen.
2. What would happen if we needed to add a new feature page to the application? How would you approach it?
3. How does the state management system work, and how would you modify it to add a new data entity?
4. What are the potential failure points in the current implementation, and how are they handled?
