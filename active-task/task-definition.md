# File Processing System - Task Definition

## Task Overview

Implement a robust file processing system for the Election Monitoring System that can detect, validate, parse, and process CSV transaction files from election smart contracts. The system will extract transaction data from these files, store it in the database, and trigger appropriate updates to related metrics and statistics.

## Objectives

1. Create a system to detect and process new CSV files containing transaction data
2. Implement a reliable parsing mechanism for transaction data
3. Store processed transactions in the database
4. Track file processing jobs and their status
5. Provide API endpoints for file upload and processing status
6. Ensure error handling and validation for all processing steps

## Scope and Deliverables

### In Scope

1. **File Detection and Management**
   - File watcher for detecting new CSV files in designated directories
   - File upload API endpoint for manual file submission
   - File validation to ensure proper format and content
   - File processing job tracking

2. **Transaction Processing**
   - CSV parsing logic for transaction data
   - Transaction validation and storage
   - Background task processing for asynchronous operations
   - Error handling and reporting

3. **API Endpoints**
   - File upload endpoint
   - Processing job status endpoint
   - Processing job management endpoints (retry, cancel)

### Out of Scope

1. Real-time WebSocket updates (to be implemented in Phase 5)
2. Anomaly detection based on transaction data (to be implemented in Phase 4)
3. Advanced metrics calculation (to be implemented in Phase 2.3)
4. User authentication and authorization for file uploads (to be added later)

## Functional Requirements

1. **File Detection and Watching**
   - The system must monitor designated directories for new CSV files
   - The system must extract metadata from file names (smart contract ID, date, time range)
   - The system must create processing jobs for new files

2. **File Upload API**
   - The system must provide an API endpoint for manual file uploads
   - The system must validate uploaded files for proper format
   - The system must return appropriate error messages for invalid files

3. **File Processing**
   - The system must parse CSV files according to the defined format
   - The system must extract transaction data from CSV files
   - The system must validate transaction data before storage
   - The system must handle both transaction types: `blindSigIssue` and `vote`
   - The system must update constituency metrics based on processed transactions

4. **Job Management**
   - The system must track the status of file processing jobs
   - The system must provide detailed error information for failed jobs
   - The system must support retrying failed jobs
   - The system must record processing statistics (transactions processed, time taken)

## Technical Requirements

1. **Architecture**
   - Implement a background task system using FastAPI background tasks
   - Use a repository pattern for database operations
   - Implement a service layer for business logic
   - Use dependency injection for components

2. **Performance**
   - Process files asynchronously to avoid blocking the API
   - Implement batch processing for large files
   - Use efficient CSV parsing techniques
   - Implement appropriate database indexing for transaction queries

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for file operations
   - Provide detailed error messages for debugging
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Log all errors with appropriate context

4. **Testing**
   - Create unit tests for CSV parsing logic
   - Create integration tests for file processing workflow
   - Create API tests for file upload endpoints
   - Implement test fixtures for sample CSV data

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

1. The system must work with the existing database models and schema
2. The system must be compatible with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
3. The system must handle files with potentially thousands of transactions
4. The system must be able to process files in various encodings (UTF-8, Windows-1251)

### Assumptions

1. CSV files will follow the defined format with semicolon-separated values
2. File names will follow the pattern: `[SmartContractID]_[Date]_[TimeRange].[extension]`
3. The directory structure will follow the hierarchy: Region > Election > Constituency > Smart Contract > Hourly Data Files
4. The system will initially process files from a local directory, with potential for cloud storage integration later

## Success Criteria

1. The system can successfully detect and process CSV files from the sample data
2. All transactions from processed files are correctly stored in the database
3. File processing jobs are properly tracked and can be monitored
4. The API endpoints for file upload and job management work correctly
5. The system handles errors gracefully and provides useful error messages
6. All tests pass successfully

## Dependencies

1. Core Data Models (completed)
2. Basic API Endpoints (completed)
3. Database configuration and connection (completed)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Large files causing memory issues | High | Implement streaming parsing and batch processing |
| Malformed CSV data | Medium | Implement robust validation and error handling |
| Duplicate transaction processing | Medium | Implement transaction ID checking before insertion |
| File system access issues | Medium | Implement proper error handling and logging |
| Performance bottlenecks with many files | High | Implement job queuing and prioritization |
