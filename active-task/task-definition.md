# Transaction Processing System Implementation

## Task Overview

Implement a comprehensive transaction processing system for the Election Monitoring System that builds upon the existing file processing capabilities. This system will handle the parsing, validation, storage, and retrieval of blockchain transaction data, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of election activities.

## Background

The Election Monitoring System processes CSV files containing blockchain transaction data. While basic file processing and transaction storage functionality exists, we need to enhance the system with dedicated transaction processing capabilities, including API endpoints, validation rules, batch processing, and comprehensive testing.

## Objectives

1. Implement dedicated transaction API endpoints for CRUD operations
2. Enhance transaction validation rules
3. Implement transaction batch processing
4. Create a comprehensive transaction query service
5. Develop transaction processing tests

## Current State

The system currently has:
- A Transaction model with fields for constituency_id, block_height, timestamp, type, raw_data, and operation_data
- Basic CRUD operations for transactions
- A TransactionService with methods for saving transactions and updating constituency metrics
- Pydantic schemas for transaction creation, update, and response
- File processing endpoints that extract and save transactions

## Requirements

### 1. Transaction API Endpoints

Implement the following RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/transactions` - List transactions with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/transactions/{id}` - Get a specific transaction by ID
- `POST /api/transactions` - Create a new transaction
- `PUT /api/transactions/{id}` - Update an existing transaction
- `DELETE /api/transactions/{id}` - Delete a transaction
- `GET /api/transactions/by-constituency/{constituency_id}` - Get transactions for a specific constituency
- `GET /api/transactions/by-type/{type}` - Get transactions of a specific type
- `GET /api/transactions/recent` - Get recent transactions

### 2. Transaction Validation Rules

Enhance transaction validation with the following rules:

- Validate transaction types (blindSigIssue, vote)
- Validate timestamp format and range
- Validate constituency existence
- Validate block height (positive integer)
- Validate raw_data structure
- Implement duplicate detection

### 3. Transaction Batch Processing

Implement batch processing capabilities:

- Process transactions in configurable batch sizes
- Implement transaction queue for asynchronous processing
- Add retry mechanism for failed transactions
- Implement transaction processing status tracking
- Create batch processing statistics

### 4. Transaction Query Service

Enhance the transaction query service with:

- Advanced filtering (by time range, type, constituency, etc.)
- Sorting options
- Pagination
- Aggregation functions (count, average, etc.)
- Time-based analysis (hourly, daily, etc.)

### 5. Transaction Processing Tests

Develop comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for transaction validation
- Integration tests for transaction API endpoints
- Performance tests for batch processing
- End-to-end tests for transaction processing workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All specified API endpoints are implemented and return correct responses
2. Transaction validation rules are enforced correctly
3. Batch processing handles large volumes of transactions efficiently
4. Query service provides accurate and performant data retrieval
5. All tests pass with at least 90% code coverage
6. Documentation is updated with new endpoints and functionality

## Dependencies

- Core Data Models (completed)
- Basic API Implementation (completed)
- File Processing System (completed)

## Deliverables

1. Transaction API endpoints implementation
2. Enhanced transaction validation
3. Batch processing implementation
4. Transaction query service
5. Comprehensive tests
6. Updated API documentation

## Technical Constraints

- Use FastAPI for API endpoints
- Use SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing file processing functionality

## Estimated Effort

- 4-6 hours

## Next Steps After Completion

After completing this task, the system will be ready for:
1. Metrics Calculation implementation
2. Anomaly Detection implementation
3. Frontend Dashboard Components development
