# File Processing System - File Structure

This document provides an overview of the files created for the File Processing System task and their purpose.

## Task Documentation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `task-definition.md` | Defines the objectives, scope, requirements, and constraints of the task |
| `task-architecture.md` | Outlines the system architecture, components, and data flow |
| `interfaces.md` | Specifies the API endpoints, service interfaces, and data models |
| `implementation-plan.md` | Provides a step-by-step plan for implementing the system |
| `verification_instructions.md` | Defines test cases and verification steps for the implementation |
| `progress.md` | Summarizes the work completed and next steps |
| `file-structure.md` | This file - provides an overview of the file structure |

## Implementation Files (To Be Created)

### Data Models and Schemas

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/models/schemas/file_metadata.py` | Schema for file metadata |
| `backend/app/models/schemas/processing_result.py` | Schema for processing results |

### Services

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/file_service.py` | Service for file processing |
| `backend/app/services/transaction_service.py` | Service for transaction processing |

### API Endpoints

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/api/routes/files.py` | API routes for file processing |

### Error Handling

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/api/errors/exceptions.py` | Custom exception classes for file processing errors |

### Tests

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/tests/services/test_file_service.py` | Tests for file service |
| `backend/tests/services/test_transaction_service.py` | Tests for transaction service |
| `backend/tests/api/test_files.py` | Tests for file API endpoints |

## File Organization

The task documentation files are organized in the `active-task` directory, following the project's task isolation principle. The implementation files will be created in the appropriate directories within the `backend` directory, following the existing project structure.

### Task Documentation Structure

```
active-task/
├── task-definition.md
├── task-architecture.md
├── interfaces.md
├── implementation-plan.md
├── verification_instructions.md
├── progress.md
└── file-structure.md
```

### Implementation Structure

```

│   │   │   └── files.py
│   │   └── errors/

```

## Integration with Existing Project

The File Processing System is designed to integrate with the existing project structure and components. It builds on the core data models and API framework that have already been implemented.

### Dependencies on Existing Components

- **Core Data Models**: The file processing system depends on the existing Transaction and Constituency models
- **API Framework**: The API endpoints depend on the existing FastAPI setup
- **Database Access**: The transaction service depends on the existing database access layer

### New Components

- **File Service**: New service for file processing
- **Transaction Service**: New service for transaction processing
- **File API Endpoints**: New API endpoints for file upload and directory processing
- **Custom Exceptions**: New exception classes for file processing errors

## Conclusion

This file structure follows the project's organization principles and integrates with the existing components. The task documentation files provide a comprehensive design for the File Processing System, and the implementation files will be created according to this structure.
