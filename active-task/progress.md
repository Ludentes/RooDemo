# Task 007: Metrics Calculation System - Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the Metrics Calculation System for the Election Monitoring System.

## Current Status
- **Start Date**: August 13, 2025
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Model and Schema Updates

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Model and Schema Updates
- [x] Reviewed existing metrics-related code and identified gaps
- [x] Updated the HourlyStats model with missing fields:
  - Added `election_id` as a foreign key to the Election model
  - Added `timestamp` field for exact timestamp
  - Added `participation_rate` field for storing participation rates
  - Added `anomaly_count` field for storing anomaly counts
  - Added relationship to Election model
- [x] Updated the HourlyStats schemas:
  - Added `election_id` field to schemas
  - Added `timestamp` field to schemas
  - Added `participation_rate` field to schemas
  - Added `anomaly_count` field to schemas
- [x] Verified the HourlyStats CRUD operations:
  - CRUD operations already referenced the fields we added
  - No updates needed as they were already consistent with the model changes
- [x] Attempted to reset the database:
  - Created a recreate_db.py script to recreate the database schema
  - Encountered permission issues with the database file
  - Decided to proceed with implementation since model and schema files are updated
- [x] Implemented the hourly statistics aggregation service:
  - Created backend/app/services/hourly_stats_service.py
  - Implemented methods to aggregate transaction data into hourly statistics
  - Added support for aggregating data for specific constituencies, time ranges, and elections
  - Implemented calculation of metrics like bulletins issued, votes cast, transaction count
  - Added calculation of velocities and participation rates
- [x] Created the constituency metrics calculator:
  - Created backend/app/services/constituency_metrics_service.py
  - Implemented methods to calculate metrics for constituencies based on hourly stats
  - Added support for calculating metrics by time period (hour, day, week, month)
  - Implemented calculation of total metrics, participation rates, and anomaly scores
  - Added calculation of hourly activity patterns and velocity trends
  - Implemented methods to update constituency model with calculated metrics
- [x] Implemented participation rate calculation:
  - Added participation rate calculation to hourly statistics aggregation service
  - Added participation rate calculation to constituency metrics calculator
  - Implemented formula: (votes_cast / registered_voters) * 100.0
  - Added support for updating constituency model with participation rate
- [x] Set up automatic metrics updates:
  - Created backend/app/services/metrics_update_service.py
  - Implemented queue-based system for metrics updates
  - Added support for different update triggers (new transaction, scheduled update, manual trigger)
  - Implemented asynchronous processing of updates
  - Added failure handling and retries
  - Implemented periodic updates for active elections
- [x] Created metrics caching system:
  - Created backend/app/services/metrics_cache_service.py
  - Implemented in-memory cache backend
  - Added support for time-based expiration
  - Implemented cache invalidation strategies using tags
  - Created helper methods for generating cache keys
  - Added a caching decorator for easy integration with services
- [x] Implemented metrics API endpoints:
  - Created backend/app/api/routes/metrics.py
  - Implemented endpoints for hourly stats, constituency metrics, and election metrics
  - Added endpoints for dashboard metrics
  - Implemented cache integration for all endpoints
  - Added cache invalidation endpoints
  - Updated API router and OpenAPI schema to include metrics endpoints
- [x] Wrote metrics calculation tests:
  - Created backend/tests/test_models/test_hourly_stats.py for testing the HourlyStats model
  - Created backend/tests/test_crud/test_hourly_stats_crud.py for testing the HourlyStats CRUD operations
  - Created backend/tests/services/test_hourly_stats_service.py for testing the hourly statistics aggregation service
  - Created backend/tests/services/test_constituency_metrics_service.py for testing the constituency metrics calculator
  - Created backend/tests/api/test_metrics.py for testing the metrics API endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation
- [ ] Implement the hourly statistics aggregation service
- [ ] Implement the constituency metrics calculator
- [ ] Implement the participation rate calculation
- [ ] Implement the metrics caching system
- [ ] Write tests for the core services

### Phase 3: Automatic Update Mechanism
- [ ] Implement the metrics update service
- [ ] Implement the update queue
- [ ] Implement the scheduled updates
- [ ] Implement the update triggers
- [ ] Write tests for the update mechanism

### Phase 4: API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement the metrics API router
- [ ] Implement the hourly stats endpoints
- [ ] Implement the constituency metrics endpoints
- [ ] Implement the election metrics endpoints
- [ ] Implement the dashboard metrics endpoints
- [ ] Write tests for the API endpoints

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate all components
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Perform performance testing
- [ ] Fix any issues found during testing
- [ ] Document the metrics calculation system

## Next Steps
1. Update the HourlyStats schemas to include the new fields
2. Update the HourlyStats CRUD operations to use the new fields
3. Create a database migration for the model changes
4. Run the migration to update the database schema

## Issues and Challenges
- None reported yet

## Notes
- The HourlyStats model has been updated with the missing fields as per the implementation plan
- Need to ensure all CRUD operations correctly use the new fields
- Need to update the schemas to match the model changes
