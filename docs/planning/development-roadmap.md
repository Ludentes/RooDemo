## First Task Recommendation

Based on the roadmap, the recommended first task is:

### Task 1: Core Data Models Implementation

**Objective**: Implement the foundational database models that will support the entire application.

**Scope**:
- Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities (Election, Constituency, Transaction, Alert, HourlyStats, FileProcessingJob)
- Implement relationships between models
- Create Pydantic schemas for API request/response validation
- Set up initial Alembic migration
- Implement basic database access functions
- Create unit tests for models and validation

**Why Start Here**:
- This task is foundational - all other components depend on the data model
- It's clearly scoped and can be completed in 2-4 hours
- It's low risk with straightforward implementation
- It provides immediate value for subsequent tasks
- It allows for early validation of the data architecture

**Next Step**: Start with Task Architect mode to plan the implementation details before coding.
