# Election Monitoring System - Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements
This project is functionally complete when:
- [ ] Data ingestion system can import and process hourly CSV transaction files
- [ ] Real-time dashboard displays all active constituencies with key metrics
- [ ] Anomaly detection system identifies at least 5 types of voting irregularities
