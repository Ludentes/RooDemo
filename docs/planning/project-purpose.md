# Election Monitoring System - Project Purpose and Context

## What Problem Are We Solving?
The Election Monitoring System addresses the need for real-time surveillance and anomaly detection in blockchain-based electronic voting. It provides election observers with tools to monitor transaction logs from multiple smart contracts representing different constituencies, identify irregularities, and ensure election integrity during a 3-day voting period.

## Who Is This For?
- **Primary Users**: Election observers monitoring blockchain-based electronic voting
- **Secondary Users**: Election authorities, international organizations, technical support teams
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Real-time monitoring of voting patterns across constituencies
  - Detection of voting irregularities and anomalies
  - Investigation of suspicious activities
  - Generation of reports for official documentation
  - Coordination of observer teams during election periods

## Success Definition
- **Primary Success Metric**: Successful detection of voting anomalies with minimal false positives
- **Secondary Metrics**: 
  - System uptime during election periods (99.9%)
  - Data processing speed (hourly files processed within 2 minutes)
  - Observer satisfaction with usability and insights
- **User Success**: Election observers can quickly identify, investigate, and document potential irregularities across hundreds of constituencies without information overload.

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**: 
  - Real-time dashboard for monitoring constituencies
  - Anomaly detection for voting irregularities
  - Alert management system with investigation workflow
  - File processing for CSV transaction logs
  - WebSocket updates for live dashboard
  - Detailed constituency analysis
  
- **Out of Scope**: 
  - Direct intervention in voting systems
  - Voter authentication or identity verification
  - Integration with external election management systems
  - Public-facing interfaces for voters
  
- **Future Considerations**: 
  - Advanced machine learning for anomaly detection
  - Multi-region deployment for global elections
  - Integration with other election monitoring tools
  - Mobile application for field observers

## Technical Context
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy, SQLite (upgradeable to PostgreSQL)
  - Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
  - Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose
  
- **Integration Points**: 
  - CSV file input from blockchain transaction logs
  - Potential future API integrations with election authorities
  
- **Performance Expectations**: 
  - Support monitoring of up to 500 concurrent constituencies
  - Process hourly files within 2 minutes
  - Dashboard refresh rate of maximum 30 seconds
  - Query response time under 5 seconds
  
- **Constraints**: 
  - Must operate in environments with potentially unreliable internet
  - Limited technical expertise of primary users
  - Time-critical operations during election periods
  - Need for clear, actionable insights from complex data

## Business Context
- **Why Now**: Increasing adoption of blockchain-based electronic voting requires sophisticated monitoring tools to ensure election integrity.
- **Success Timeline**: MVP needed before the next election cycle (3 months)
- **Resources Available**: Small development team (3-5 developers), limited budget
- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Complex data processing requirements
  - Need for high reliability during critical election periods
  - Evolving blockchain voting technologies
  - Varying requirements across different election types
