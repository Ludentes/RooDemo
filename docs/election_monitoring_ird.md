# Election Monitoring System - Initial Requirements Document (IRD)

## 1. General Description

### System Overview
The Election Monitoring System is a specialized analytics and surveillance tool designed for election observers monitoring blockchain-based electronic voting conducted via mobile applications.

## 4. User Portrait

### Primary User: Senior Election Observer

**Name:** Maria Rodriguez  
**Role:** Senior International Election Observer  
**Age:** 45  
**Experience:** 12 years in election monitoring across 25+ countries

**Background:**
- Former government elections official with extensive field experience
- Leads teams of 8-12 junior observers during major elections
- Proficient with basic technology but not a technical specialist
- Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese

**Goals:**
- Ensure election integrity through comprehensive monitoring
- Quickly identify and investigate potential irregularities
- Provide credible, evidence-based reports to international organizations
- Coordinate effectively with local election authorities

**Pain Points:**
- Information overload from multiple data sources
- Difficulty spotting patterns across hundreds of constituencies
- Time pressure to investigate anomalies before they escalate
- Need to explain technical findings to non-technical stakeholders

**Technology Comfort Level:**
- Comfortable with tablets and basic software applications
- Prefers visual dashboards over raw data
- Needs clear, actionable alerts rather than technical details
- Values systems that "just work" without configuration

**Work Environment:**
- Operates from temporary election observation centers
- Works 12-16 hour days during election periods
- Coordinates with teams across different time zones
- Requires reliable internet but may face connectivity issues

## 5. User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Election Day Briefing
Maria arrives at the observation center at 6 AM on the second day of voting. She needs to quickly assess overnight activity across all constituencies to brief her team and identify priority areas for investigation.

### Scenario 2: Real-time Anomaly Response
At 2 PM, the system alerts Maria to unusual voting patterns in three urban constituencies showing simultaneous voting spikes. She needs to quickly investigate, document findings, and coordinate with field observers.

### Scenario 3: End-of-Day Analysis
As voting concludes at 8 PM, Maria must generate comprehensive reports showing participation rates, identified anomalies, and overall election integrity assessment for submission to election authorities.

### Scenario 4: Cross-Constituency Investigation
Maria notices that rural constituencies in one region show consistently low bulletin-to-vote ratios. She needs to compare these patterns with similar regions and historical data to determine if investigation is warranted.

### Scenario 5: Technical Issue Management
During peak voting hours, one constituency's data feed stops updating. Maria needs to identify the issue, assess its impact on monitoring coverage, and coordinate with technical teams for resolution.
