# Verification Instructions for Core Data Models Implementation

## Gate 1: AI Self-Verification (Automated) ‚úÖ

The following checks have been completed:
- ‚úÖ Code compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ Type checking passes
- ‚úÖ No undefined variables or functions
- ‚úÖ Required dependencies imported
- ‚úÖ Basic logical consistency check
- ‚úÖ All tests pass

## Gate 2: Human Verification (Manual) ‚è≥

Please perform the following verification steps:

1. **Run the tests manually**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python run_tests.py
   ```
   Verify that all tests pass without errors.

2. **Inspect the database models**:
   - Check the SQLAlchemy models in `backend/app/models/`
   - Verify that all required fields and relationships are properly defined
   - Ensure that the models match the data model documentation

3. **Inspect the Pydantic schemas**:
   - Check the Pydantic schemas in `backend/app/models/schemas/`
   - Verify that all validation rules are properly defined
   - Ensure that the schemas match the API contracts documentation

4. **Inspect the CRUD operations**:
   - Check the CRUD operations in `backend/app/crud/`
   - Verify that all required operations are implemented
   - Ensure that the operations handle errors properly

5. **Verify database migrations**:
   - Check the Alembic migrations in `backend/alembic/versions/`
   - Verify that the migrations create the correct database schema
   - Run the migrations to ensure they work properly:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     python run_migrations.py
     ```

Once you have completed these steps, please type "verified" to confirm that you have personally verified the implementation.

## Gate 3: Understanding Validation (Quiz) üîÑ

After Gate 2 is completed, you will be presented with a quiz to validate your understanding of the implementation.
