# Core Data Models Implementation - COMPLETED

## Task Summary
This task involved implementing the core data models for the Election Monitoring System, including SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, database access operations, and unit tests.

## Accomplishments

1. **SQLAlchemy Models Implemented**:
   - Election, Constituency, Transaction, Alert, HourlyStats, and FileProcessingJob models
   - Proper relationships and cascade behaviors configured
   - Appropriate indexes for performance optimization

2. **Pydantic Schemas Implemented**:
   - Base schemas with common validation logic
   - Create, Update, and Response schemas for each model
   - Validation rules for data integrity

3. **Database Access (CRUD) Operations Implemented**:
   - Generic BaseCRUD class for common operations
   - Model-specific CRUD classes with specialized methods
   - Fixed datetime handling in CRUD operations

4. **Alembic Migrations Set Up**:
   - Initial migration script created
   - Migration environment configured

5. **Unit Tests Implemented and Passing**:
   - Tests for models, schemas, and CRUD operations
   - Fixed foreign key constraint enforcement in SQLite
   - All tests now pass successfully

6. **Triple-Gate Control Process Applied**:
   - Gate 1 (AI Self-Verification): All tests pass, code compiles without errors
   - Gate 2 (Human Verification): Implementation personally verified
   - Gate 3 (Understanding Validation): Quiz completed with AI assistance

## Issues Fixed

1. Added the updated_at field to the TimestampMixin
2. Enabled foreign key constraints in SQLite for testing
3. Fixed datetime handling in the CRUD operations
4. Added missing methods to the ElectionCRUD class
5. Fixed the get_upcoming_elections method to include both "upcoming" and "scheduled" statuses

## Technical Decisions

1. **SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Type Annotations**: Provides better type safety and IDE support
2. **Repository Pattern (CRUD Operations)**: Promotes code reuse and separation of concerns
3. **Pydantic for Validation**: Provides automatic validation and serialization/deserialization
4. **Alembic for Migrations**: Manages schema changes in a controlled manner
5. **Relationship Cascade Behavior**: Ensures data integrity when parent records are deleted
6. **Mixins for Common Functionality**: Promotes DRY principles
7. **SQLite for Testing**: Provides fast, isolated test environments
