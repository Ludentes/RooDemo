2. **Docstrings**
   - Add docstrings to all classes, methods, and functions
   - Follow Google docstring format
   - Include parameter descriptions and return types

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use appropriate exception handling
   - Create custom exceptions where needed
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use CamelCase for class names
   - Use snake_case for variables and functions
   - Use ALL_CAPS for constants
   - Use descriptive names that reflect purpose

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for at least 80% test coverage
   - Test all public methods and functions
   - Include both positive and negative test cases

2. **Test Organization**
   - Organize tests by component type
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Group related tests in test classes

3. **Test Data**
   - Create reusable test fixtures
   - Use factory methods for test data creation
   - Avoid hardcoded test data

### Performance Guidelines

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Optimize queries for common operations
   - Use lazy loading for relationships

2. **Memory Management**
   - Avoid loading large result sets into memory
   - Use pagination for large queries
   - Close database sessions properly

## Triple-Gate Control Process

To ensure high-quality implementation and knowledge transfer, the core data models implementation will follow a strict triple-gate control process. Each component must pass through all three gates before being considered complete.

### Gate 1: AI Self-Verification (Automated)

**Purpose**: Catch obvious technical issues before human review

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] No undefined variables or functions
- [ ] Required dependencies imported
- [ ] Basic logical consistency check
- [ ] Follows project formatting standards

**Implementation**:
1. After each component implementation, run automated checks:
   - Run `mypy` for type checking
   - Run linting with `flake8`
   - Verify imports and dependencies
   - Run basic unit tests

2. Document the results in a verification report:
   ```
   ✅ Gate 1 Self-Check Complete - Basic validation passed
   ```

### Gate 2: Mandatory Human Verification (Manual)

**Purpose**: Ensure human actively engages with implementation

**Universal Requirements**:
- [ ] Actually run/execute the code manually
- [ ] Inspect the output/behavior with your own eyes
- [ ] Review the code changes line by line
- [ ] Confirm it does what it's supposed to do

**Component-Specific Requirements**:

**For Models**:
- [ ] Verify model creation with sample data
- [ ] Test relationships between models
- [ ] Confirm constraints are enforced
- [ ] Check that indexes are properly defined

**For Schemas**:
- [ ] Test validation with valid and invalid data
- [ ] Verify serialization and deserialization
- [ ] Check that relationships are properly represented
- [ ] Confirm that examples work as expected

**For CRUD Operations**:
- [ ] Test each CRUD operation with real data
- [ ] Verify error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Check transaction management
- [ ] Confirm that queries return expected results

**For Migrations**:
- [ ] Run migrations on a test database
- [ ] Verify table structure matches models
- [ ] Test rollback functionality
- [ ] Check that indexes are created correctly

**Implementation**:
1. After passing Gate 1, present the code for human verification
2. Use the following checkpoint format:
   ```
   🛑 **GATE 2 VERIFICATION REQUIRED** 🛑

   I've implemented: [COMPONENT NAME]

   **✅ Gate 1 (AI Self-Check): PASSED**
   - Code compiles without errors
   - Basic validation complete

   **⏳ Gate 2 (Human Verification): PENDING YOUR ACTION**

   You must now personally verify this implementation:
   - [ ] Run/execute the code manually
   - [ ] Inspect output with your own eyes
   - [ ] Review code changes line by line
   - [ ] [Component-specific requirements]

   **🚨 I CANNOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU CONFIRM VERIFICATION 🚨**

   Type "verified" once you have personally completed all verification steps.
   ```

3. Wait for explicit verification confirmation before proceeding

### Gate 3: Understanding Validation (Quiz)

**Purpose**: Ensure developer comprehends the implementation

**Standard Quiz Questions**:
1. "Explain the key technical decisions made in this implementation and why"
2. "What would happen if [edge case scenario]?"
3. "How would you modify this implementation for [different requirement]?"
4. "What are the potential failure points and how are they handled?"

**Implementation**:
1. After passing Gate 2, present understanding validation questions
2. Evaluate responses to ensure at least 80% understanding
3. Document the results in a validation report:
   ```
   ✅ Gate 3 Understanding Validation: PASSED
   ```

### Gate Enforcement Rules

1. **Sequential Progression**: Gates must be passed in order (1 → 2 → 3)
2. **No Skipping**: All gates are mandatory for all components
3. **Documentation**: Gate status must be documented for each component
4. **Blocking**: Failure at any gate blocks progress until resolved
5. **Verification Format**: Use the standard checkpoint format for Gate 2
6. **Understanding Threshold**: 80%+ understanding required to pass Gate 3
