# Task 1: Core Data Models Implementation

## Generated from Project Documentation

### Objective
Implement the foundational database models that will support the entire Election Monitoring System application.

### Context from Project Documentation
- **Related User Scenarios**: All scenarios require the data model as foundation
- **Technical Requirements**: Based on the data model defined in docs/planning/data-model.md
- **Dependencies**: None (this is the first foundational task)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities:
  - [ ] Election model with relationships
  - [ ] Constituency model with relationships
  - [ ] Transaction model with relationships
  - [ ] Alert model with relationships
  - [ ] HourlyStats model with relationships
  - [ ] FileProcessingJob model
- [ ] Implement proper relationships between models
- [ ] Create Pydantic schemas for API request/response validation
- [ ] Set up initial Alembic migration
- [ ] Implement basic database access functions
- [ ] Create unit tests for models and validation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All models correctly implement the fields specified in the data model documentation
- [ ] Relationships between models are properly defined and work as expected
- [ ] Pydantic schemas correctly validate input and output data
- [ ] Alembic migration successfully creates all tables in the database
- [ ] Database access functions can perform basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Unit tests verify model functionality and constraints
- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards and best practices

### Architecture Approach
**Recommended Next Step**: Start with Task Architect mode

**Why**: This task requires careful planning of the data model structure before implementation. The Task Architect mode will help define the exact implementation details, relationships, and validation rules before coding begins.

### Implementation Scope
- **Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `backend/app/models/database.py` - SQLAlchemy models
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py` - Pydantic schemas
  - `backend/alembic/versions/xxxx_initial_migration.py` - Migration script
  - `backend/app/models/crud.py` - Database access functions
  - `backend/tests/test_models/` - Unit tests for models

- **Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-6 hours)
- **Risk Level**: Low (straightforward implementation with clear requirements)

### Success Definition
This task is complete when:
1. ✅ All technical requirements implemented
2. ✅ All acceptance criteria met
3. ✅ Triple-gate verification passed:
   - Technical validation: All models work correctly in the database
   - Human verification: Manual testing confirms data relationships
   - Understanding validation: Knowledge transfer of data model complete
4. ✅ Integration with existing code confirmed
5. ✅ Documentation updated

### Dependencies and Blockers
- **Depends On**: Project setup (repository structure)
- **Blocks**: 
  - Basic API Endpoints implementation
  - Transaction Processing
  - File Processing System
  - All other components that rely on the data model
- **External Dependencies**: None

### Context for Next Steps
When this task is complete, it enables:
- Implementation of API endpoints that use these models
- Development of the transaction processing system
- Creation of the file processing pipeline
- Implementation of the metrics calculation system

## Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack
- FastAPI 0.115.13 (latest as of August 2025)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.41 (latest as of May 2025)
- Pydantic 2.5.0 (current version)
- Alembic 1.13.0 (current version)

### Model Design Considerations
- Use UUID for primary keys where appropriate
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Consider future PostgreSQL migration when designing models
- Use appropriate field types and constraints

### Validation Rules
- Implement validators for critical fields
- Ensure proper error messages for validation failures
- Consider adding custom validation methods

### Testing Strategy
- Test model creation and relationships
- Test constraint violations
- Test edge cases for data types
- Verify migration correctness

### Future Considerations
- The models should be designed with potential future extensions in mind
- Consider adding audit fields for tracking changes
- Plan for potential schema evolution
