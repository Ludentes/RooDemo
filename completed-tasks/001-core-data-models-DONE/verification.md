# Gate 3: Understanding Validation Quiz

Now that you've verified the implementation, please answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the core data models implementation:

## Question 1: Technical Decisions
What were the key technical decisions made in the implementation of the core data models, and why were these decisions made?

## Question 2: Edge Case Handling
How would the system handle a scenario where an election is deleted while it has active constituencies? What mechanisms are in place to ensure data integrity?

## Question 3: Modification Scenario
If we needed to add a new field to track the number of invalid votes in a constituency, what changes would be required across the codebase?

## Question 4: Potential Failure Points
What are the potential failure points in the current implementation, and how are they handled?

Please provide detailed answers to these questions to demonstrate your understanding of the implementation.
