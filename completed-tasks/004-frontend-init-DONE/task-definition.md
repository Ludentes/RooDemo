# Frontend Infrastructure Task Definition

## Overview

This task involves setting up the foundational frontend infrastructure for the Election Monitoring System. We'll establish a modern, maintainable, and scalable frontend architecture using React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn/ui components. This infrastructure will serve as the foundation for all subsequent frontend development tasks.

## Objectives

1. Create a new frontend project structure with proper organization and configuration
2. Set up the core state management system using Zustand
3. Implement a flexible API client service for backend communication
4. Create common UI components using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS 4
5. Establish routing with React Router
6. Implement error handling and notification systems
7. Create a responsive layout framework

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Project Structure**
   - Organized directory structure following best practices
   - Clear separation of concerns (components, hooks, services, etc.)
   - Proper TypeScript configuration

2. **State Management**
   - Global state management with Zustand
   - Type-safe store definitions
   - Modular store structure (separate stores for different domains)
   - Persistence for relevant state

3. **API Client**
   - Type-safe API client for backend communication
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Error handling
   - Authentication token management
   - Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests

4. **UI Components**
   - Implementation of shadcn/ui components
   - Custom theme configuration
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS 4
   - Accessibility compliance

5. **Routing**
   - Route configuration with React Router
   - Lazy loading for route components
   - Not-found handling

6. **Error Handling & Notifications**
   - Global error boundary
   - Toast notifications system
   - Error logging service

7. **Layout Framework**
   - Responsive layout components
   - Sidebar navigation
   - Header with application information
   - Main content area

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Fast initial load time (<2s)
   - Code splitting for optimized bundle size
   - Efficient re-rendering

2. **Maintainability**
   - Consistent code style with ESLint and Prettier
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Type safety with TypeScript

3. **Scalability**
   - Modular architecture for easy extension
   - Reusable component patterns
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility

## Scope

### In Scope

- Project setup and configuration
- Core infrastructure components
- Basic layout and navigation
- State management setup
- API client implementation
- Error handling and notifications

### Out of Scope

- Specific feature implementations (dashboard, constituency details, etc.)
- Backend API implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage (basic tests only)
- Production deployment configuration
- Analytics integration

## Dependencies

- Completion of Core Data Models (Task 1) ✅
- Completion of API Implementation (Task 2) ✅
- Completion of File Processing System (Task 3) ✅

## Deliverables

1. Frontend project structure with all configurations
2. State management implementation
3. API client service
4. Common UI components library
5. Routing implementation
6. Error handling and notification system
7. Responsive layout framework
8. Documentation for the frontend architecture

## Success Criteria

1. All required configurations and setups are complete
2. The application can be started in development mode without errors
3. Basic navigation between placeholder pages works correctly
4. API client can make requests to the backend
5. State management is properly implemented
6. UI components render correctly and are responsive
7. Error handling captures and displays errors appropriately
