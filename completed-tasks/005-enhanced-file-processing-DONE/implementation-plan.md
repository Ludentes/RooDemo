# File Processing System Enhancement - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for implementing the file processing system enhancements.

## Phase 1: Folder Structure Processing

### Step 1: Create Region Model and Schema

1. Create `backend/app/models/region.py` with the Region model
2. Create `backend/app/models/schemas/region.py` with the Region schema
3. Create a database migration for the Region table

### Step 2: Enhance File Metadata and Processing Result Schemas

1. Update `backend/app/models/schemas/file_metadata.py` to add fields for region, election, and constituency information
2. Update `backend/app/models/schemas/processing_result.py` to add fields for region, election, and constituency information

### Step 3: Implement Region Service

1. Create `backend/app/services/region_service.py` with methods for creating, updating, and retrieving regions
2. Add CRUD operations for regions in `backend/app/crud/region.py`

### Step 4: Enhance File Service

1. Update `backend/app/services/file_service.py` to extract metadata from folder structure
2. Modify the `process_file` method to use enhanced metadata
3. Modify the `process_directory` method to use enhanced metadata and create/update regions, elections, and constituencies

### Step 5: Update API Endpoints

1. Update `backend/app/api/routes/files.py` to use enhanced file service
2. Add dependency injection for region service

### Step 6: Create Tests for Enhanced Functionality

1. Create unit tests for region model and schema
2. Create unit tests for region service
3. Update unit tests for file service
4. Update API tests for file routes

## Phase 2: Code Refactoring

### Step 1: Remove Debug Print Statements

1. Remove print statements from `backend/app/services/file_service.py`
2. Remove print statements from `backend/app/services/transaction_service.py`
3. Remove print statements from `backend/app/api/routes/files.py`

### Step 2: Consolidate Error Handling

1. Review error handling in `backend/app/services/file_service.py`
2. Review error handling in `backend/app/services/transaction_service.py`
3. Review error handling in `backend/app/api/routes/files.py`
4. Create common error handling patterns and apply them consistently

### Step 3: Simplify Complex Methods

1. Refactor `_parse_json_like_structure` method in `backend/app/services/file_service.py`
2. Refactor `extract_transactions_from_csv` method in `backend/app/services/file_service.py`
3. Refactor `process_directory` method in `backend/app/services/file_service.py`

### Step 4: Move Test Code to Proper Test Files

1. Move test code from `backend/app/services/file_service.py` to `backend/tests/services/test_file_service.py`
2. Ensure all test code is properly organized in test files

### Step 5: Improve Documentation

1. Update docstrings in `backend/app/services/file_service.py`
2. Update docstrings in `backend/app/services/transaction_service.py`
3. Update docstrings in `backend/app/api/routes/files.py`
4. Ensure all new code has proper documentation

## Phase 3: File Watching

### Step 1: Add Watchdog Dependency

1. Add watchdog to `backend/requirements.txt`
2. Install the dependency

### Step 2: Implement File Watcher Service

1. Create `backend/app/services/file_watcher_service.py` with methods for watching directories
2. Implement event handlers for file system events
3. Implement methods for starting and stopping watchers

### Step 3: Add API Endpoints for File Watching

1. Update `backend/app/api/routes/files.py` to add endpoints for starting and stopping file watching
2. Implement request validation and error handling

### Step 4: Create Tests for File Watching

1. Create unit tests for file watcher service
2. Create API tests for file watching endpoints
3. Create integration tests for file watching functionality

### Step 5: Update Documentation

1. Create `backend/docs/file_watching.md` with documentation for file watching
2. Update `backend/docs/end_to_end_testing.md` to include file watching tests
3. Update API documentation for new endpoints

## Timeline

### Week 1: Folder Structure Processing

- Day 1-2: Create Region model, schema, and service
- Day 3-4: Enhance File Service
- Day 5: Update API endpoints and create tests

### Week 2: Code Refactoring and File Watching

- Day 1-2: Code refactoring
- Day 3-4: Implement file watching
- Day 5: Create tests and update documentation

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

1. Python 3.8+
2. FastAPI
3. SQLAlchemy
4. Watchdog 3.0.0+
5. Alembic for database migrations

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Database Schema Changes

**Risk**: Adding region information might require database migrations that could affect existing data.

**Mitigation**: 
- Create a backup of the database before applying migrations
- Test migrations on a staging environment
- Implement rollback procedures

### Risk 2: Performance Impact

**Risk**: Processing folder structure might impact performance, especially for large directories.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement caching for folder structure information
- Optimize code for performance
- Add pagination for large directories

### Risk 3: File Watching Resource Usage

**Risk**: Continuous file watching might consume excessive resources.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement configurable polling intervals
- Add resource limits and monitoring
- Provide options to pause or stop watching when not needed

### Risk 4: Backward Compatibility

**Risk**: Changes might break existing functionality.

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Provide migration paths for clients
- Add version information to APIs

## Success Criteria

1. All unit tests pass
2. All integration tests pass
3. All end-to-end tests pass
4. Performance meets or exceeds baseline
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
6. Code quality meets standards
7. All requirements are met
