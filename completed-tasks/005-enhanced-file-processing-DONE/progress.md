## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Folder Structure Processing

#### Create Region Model and Schema
- [ ] Create `backend/app/models/region.py`
- [ ] Create `backend/app/models/schemas/region.py`
- [ ] Create database migration for Region table

- [ ] Create `backend/app/crud/region.py`

#### Enhance File Service
- [ ] Add method for extracting metadata from folder structure
- [ ] Update process_file method to use enhanced metadata
- [ ] Update process_directory method to use enhanced metadata

#### Update API Endpoints
- [ ] Update file upload endpoint to use enhanced metadata
- [ ] Update directory processing endpoint to use enhanced metadata

#### Create Tests for Enhanced Functionality

#### Simplify Complex Methods
- [ ] Refactor `_parse_json_like_structure` method
- [ ] Refactor `extract_transactions_from_csv` method
- [ ] Refactor `process_directory` method

#### Move Test Code to Proper Test Files
