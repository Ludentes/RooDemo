# End-to-End Testing Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of end-to-end testing for the File Processing System.

## Overview

End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. For the File Processing System, end-to-end testing involves:

1. Uploading CSV files via the API
2. Verifying that transactions are extracted correctly
3. Verifying that transactions are stored in the database
4. Verifying that constituency metrics are updated correctly
5. Verifying that transaction statistics can be retrieved

## Implementation

The following components were implemented to support end-to-end testing:

### 1. End-to-End Test Script

Created `backend/run_e2e_tests.py` to:
- Set up an in-memory test database
- Start the FastAPI application
- Run the end-to-end tests
- Clean up the test environment

### 2. End-to-End Test Cases

Created `backend/tests/api/test_files.py` with the following test cases:
- `test_file_upload_end_to_end`: Tests the complete flow from file upload to database storage and metrics updates
- `test_directory_processing_end_to_end`: Tests processing all files in a directory
- `test_invalid_file_upload`: Tests uploading an invalid file
- `test_nonexistent_directory_processing`: Tests processing a nonexistent directory
- `test_nonexistent_constituency_statistics`: Tests getting statistics for a nonexistent constituency

### 3. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `backend/docs/end_to_end_testing.md`: Detailed guide on how to perform end-to-end testing
- `backend/tests/api/README.md`: Quick overview of the end-to-end tests
- Updated `backend/scripts/README.md` to include information about the end-to-end testing script

### 4. Command-Line Tool

Created `backend/scripts/process_file.py` to demonstrate how to use the File Processing System from the command line:
- Process a single CSV file
- Process all files in a directory
- Display transaction statistics

### 5. Configuration

Updated `backend/pytest.ini` to register the `integration` mark used in the end-to-end tests.

## Test Data

The end-to-end tests use sample CSV files from the `data/sample-data/` directory. These files contain real transaction data that can be used to test the File Processing System.

## Running the Tests

To run the end-to-end tests:

```bash
cd backend
python run_e2e_tests.py
```

## Conclusion

The end-to-end testing implementation provides a comprehensive way to verify that the File Processing System works correctly from start to finish. It tests all aspects of the system, from file upload to database storage and metrics updates, ensuring that the system meets the requirements specified in the task definition and architecture design.

## Troubleshooting

During implementation, we encountered and fixed the following issues:

1. **Foreign Key Constraint Error**: Initially, we were creating a test constituency without first creating the corresponding election, which caused a foreign key constraint error. We fixed this by adding a `test_election` fixture that creates a test election before creating the test constituency.

2. **In-Memory Database Setup**: We initially tried to use an asynchronous approach to set up the in-memory database, but this caused issues with SQLAlchemy. We fixed this by using a synchronous approach to set up the database.

3. **Absolute File Paths**: We initially used absolute file paths for the sample CSV files, which would not work across different environments. We fixed this by using relative paths from the project root directory.

4. **Temporary File Names**: When uploading files via the API, FastAPI creates a temporary file with a random name, which caused issues with metadata extraction from the filename. We fixed this by modifying the `process_file` method to accept an optional `original_filename` parameter and using it for metadata extraction.

5. **Data Type Mismatch**: The `TransactionData` class expects `raw_data` and `operation_data` to be dictionaries, but the `_parse_json_like_structure` method returns lists of dictionaries. This caused validation errors when saving transactions to the database. We fixed this by converting the lists to dictionaries before passing them to the `TransactionData` constructor.

6. **Database Sharing Issue**: The end-to-end tests were failing because the in-memory SQLite database created in the main process wasn't accessible to the API server running in a separate process. We fixed this by using a file-based SQLite database instead of an in-memory database, so that both processes can access the same database.

7. **Test Data Creation Issue**: The test data (election and constituency) was not being created in the database before the API server was started, causing the API to not find the constituency when trying to update metrics. We fixed this by adding a `create_test_data` function to the `run_e2e_tests.py` script that creates the test data directly in the database before starting the API server.

These fixes ensure that the end-to-end tests are robust and can be run in any environment.
