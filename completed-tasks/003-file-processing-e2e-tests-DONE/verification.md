- ✅ **DirectoryProcessingResult Schema**: Implemented in `backend/app/models/schemas/processing_result.py`
  - Contains files_processed, transactions_processed, and constituency_id fields

- ✅ **TransactionData Schema**: Implemented in `backend/app/models/schemas/processing_result.py`
  - Contains transaction_id, constituency_id, block_height, timestamp, type, raw_data, and operation_data fields

### File Service

- ✅ **FileService**: Implemented in `backend/app/services/file_service.py`
  - Extracts metadata from filenames
  - Parses CSV files and extracts transactions
  - Processes directories containing multiple files
  - Handles errors gracefully

### Transaction Service

- ✅ **TransactionService**: Implemented in `backend/app/services/transaction_service.py`
  - Saves transactions to the database
  - Updates constituency metrics based on transactions
  - Provides transaction statistics
  - Handles errors gracefully

### API Endpoints

- ✅ **File Upload Endpoint**: Implemented in `backend/app/api/routes/files.py`
  - Accepts CSV files via POST request
  - Processes files and returns results
  - Handles errors gracefully

- ✅ **Directory Processing Endpoint**: Implemented in `backend/app/api/routes/files.py`
  - Accepts directory path via POST request
  - Processes all files in the directory
  - Handles errors gracefully

- ✅ **Transaction Statistics Endpoint**: Implemented in `backend/app/api/routes/files.py`
  - Returns transaction statistics for a constituency
  - Handles errors gracefully

### Error Handling

- ✅ **Custom Exceptions**: Implemented in `backend/app/api/errors/exceptions.py`
  - FileProcessingError
  - MetadataExtractionError
  - TransactionExtractionError
  - DirectoryProcessingError
  - TransactionSaveError
  - MetricsUpdateError

- ✅ **Exception Handlers**: Implemented in `backend/app/api/errors/handlers.py`
  - Handlers for all custom exceptions
  - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Unit Tests

- ✅ **File Service Tests**: Implemented in `backend/tests/services/test_file_service.py`
  - Tests for metadata extraction
  - Tests for CSV parsing
  - Tests for transaction extraction
  - Tests for error handling

- ✅ **Transaction Service Tests**: Implemented in `backend/tests/services/test_transaction_service.py`
  - Tests for saving transactions
  - Tests for updating constituency metrics
  - Tests for getting transaction statistics
  - Tests for error handling

- ✅ **API Endpoint Tests**: Implemented in `backend/tests/api/test_files.py`
  - Tests for file upload endpoint
  - Tests for directory processing endpoint
  - Tests for transaction statistics endpoint
  - Tests for error handling

## Integration Verification

The File Processing System integrates with the existing codebase as follows:

- ✅ **API Router**: Updated in `backend/app/api/__init__.py` to include the files router
- ✅ **OpenAPI Schema**: Updated in `backend/app/main.py` to include the files tag and description
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Integrated with the existing error handling system

## Functionality Verification

The File Processing System provides the following functionality:

- ✅ **File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing transaction data
- ✅ **Directory Processing**: Users can process directories containing multiple CSV files
- ✅ **Transaction Storage**: Transactions are stored in the database
- ✅ **Constituency Metrics**: Constituency metrics are updated based on transactions
- ✅ **Transaction Statistics**: Users can view transaction statistics for a constituency

## Performance Verification

The File Processing System is designed for performance:

- ✅ **Asynchronous Processing**: Files are processed asynchronously
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Large files are processed in batches
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully without crashing the system
- ✅ **Duplicate Detection**: Duplicate transactions are detected and skipped

## Security Verification

The File Processing System includes security measures:

- ✅ **File Validation**: Files are validated before processing
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: Input data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Errors are handled without exposing sensitive information

## Conclusion

The File Processing System implementation meets all the requirements specified in the task definition and architecture design. It provides a robust and efficient system for processing CSV transaction files, storing transactions in the database, and updating constituency metrics.

The implementation is well-tested, with unit tests for all components, and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase. It handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error messages to users.

The system is ready for deployment and can be used to process transaction files for the Election Monitoring System.
