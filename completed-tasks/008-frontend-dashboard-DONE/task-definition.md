# Task 008: Frontend Dashboard Implementation

## Objective
Implement the frontend dashboard components that will display metrics, statistics, and constituency data from the backend API. This task will focus on creating a comprehensive dashboard that provides election monitoring insights through visualizations and interactive components.

## Background
The Election Monitoring System now has a robust backend with metrics calculation capabilities and a basic frontend infrastructure. The next step is to connect these systems by implementing dashboard components that can fetch and display the metrics data in a user-friendly way.

## Requirements

### Core Dashboard Components
1. **Dashboard Summary Component**
   - Display key metrics for the selected election
   - Show overall participation rates, transaction counts, and activity levels
   - Implement refresh functionality to update data

2. **Constituency Overview List**
   - Create a filterable, sortable list of constituencies
   - Display key metrics for each constituency
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add search functionality

3. **Statistics Summary Cards**
   - Create reusable card components for displaying metrics
   - Implement different card types for different metric categories
   - Add visual indicators for trends (up/down arrows, colors)

4. **Activity Timeline Visualization**
   - Create a timeline component showing activity over time
   - Implement filtering by time period (hour, day, week)
   - Add interactive elements for exploring specific time points

### API Integration
1. **API Client Enhancement**
   - Extend the API client to connect to metrics endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

2. **Real-time Data Updates**
   - Implement polling for regular data updates
   - Add visual indicators for data freshness
   - Ensure efficient updates without unnecessary re-renders

### Routing and Navigation
1. **Dashboard Routes**
   - Set up React Router for dashboard navigation
   - Implement route parameters for filtering and selection
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for context

2. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Create a responsive dashboard layout
   - Implement sidebar navigation for dashboard sections
   - Add header with context-sensitive controls

### User Experience
1. **Filtering and Sorting**
   - Implement comprehensive filtering options for all data views
   - Add sorting functionality for tables and lists
   - Create filter presets for common use cases

2. **Interactive Elements**
   - Add tooltips for metric explanations
   - Implement drill-down functionality for detailed views
   - Create interactive charts with hover states

## Technical Constraints
- Use the existing Zustand store architecture
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Follow the established component structure and styling approach
- Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout the implementation
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all components

## Deliverables
1. Dashboard summary component
2. Constituency overview list component
3. Statistics summary cards
4. Activity timeline visualization
5. Enhanced API client for metrics data
6. Dashboard routing and navigation
7. Filtering and sorting functionality
8. Unit tests for all components

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays real data from the backend API
2. All components are responsive and work on mobile devices
3. Filtering and sorting functionality works as expected
4. Navigation between dashboard sections is intuitive
5. Loading states and error handling are implemented
6. All components have appropriate unit tests
7. TypeScript types are properly defined for all components
8. Code follows the project's style guidelines

## Dependencies
- Backend metrics API endpoints (completed in Task 007)
- Frontend infrastructure (completed in Task 004)

## Estimated Effort
- Medium to Large (3-5 days)

## Priority
- High (critical for demonstrating system functionality)
