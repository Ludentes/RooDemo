# Handoff to Systematic Developer: Frontend Dashboard Implementation

## Task Overview

This task involves implementing the frontend dashboard components for the Election Monitoring System. The dashboard will display metrics, statistics, and constituency data from the backend API, providing users with insights into election monitoring through visualizations and interactive components.

## Key Documents

1. **Task Definition**: [task-definition.md](./task-definition.md) - Defines the objectives, requirements, and acceptance criteria for the task.
2. **Component Architecture**: [file-structure.md](./file-structure.md) - Outlines the component structure, hierarchy, and relationships.
3. **Interfaces**: [interfaces.md](./interfaces.md) - Defines the TypeScript interfaces for data structures and API endpoints.
4. **Implementation Plan**: [implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md) - Provides a step-by-step plan for implementing the dashboard.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (important note)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Charts**: Recharts with shadcn/ui chart components
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E testing, React Testing Library for unit tests

## Implementation Approach

The implementation is divided into five phases:

1. **Project Setup and Configuration** (1 day)
   - Install dependencies with pnpm
   - Configure CSS variables for charts
   - Set up project structure
   - Configure routing

2. **Core Infrastructure** (2 days)
   - Create type definitions
   - Implement API client
   - Create utility functions
   - Define constants
   - Implement Zustand stores
   - Create custom hooks

3. **UI Components** (3 days)
   - Implement layout components
   - Create dashboard components
   - Implement metrics components with charts
   - Create constituency components

4. **Page Components** (2 days)
   - Implement Dashboard page
   - Create Constituency Detail page
   - Implement Election Overview page

5. **Integration and Testing** (2 days)
   - Create mock data for development
   - Implement API mocking
   - Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
   - Implement unit tests

## Key Components

### Dashboard Components

- **DashboardHeader**: Displays title and controls for selecting elections and time ranges
- **MetricsSummary**: Displays a grid of metric cards showing key statistics
- **ActivityTimeline**: Shows a timeline chart of activity over time
- **ConstituencyOverview**: Displays a table of constituencies with key metrics

### Metrics Components

- **MetricCard**: Displays a single metric with label, value, and trend indicator
- **ParticipationRateChart**: Shows participation rates over time
- **TransactionVolumeChart**: Displays transaction volumes over time
- **HourlyActivityChart**: Shows activity by hour of day

### Constituency Components

- **ConstituencyTable**: Displays a table of constituencies with key metrics
- **ConstituencyFilters**: Provides filters for the constituency table
- **ConstituencySearch**: Provides search functionality for the constituency table

## API Integration

The dashboard will integrate with the following backend API endpoints:

- `/api/metrics/dashboard`: Get dashboard metrics
- `/api/metrics/hourly`: Get hourly statistics
- `/api/metrics/participation`: Get participation rates
- `/api/metrics/transactions`: Get transaction volumes
- `/api/constituencies`: Get constituencies
- `/api/elections`: Get elections

## Chart Implementation

We'll use shadcn/ui chart components with Recharts for visualizations. Key chart components include:

- **ChartContainer**: Provides a container for charts with consistent styling
- **ChartTooltip**: Provides tooltips for chart data points
- **ChartLegend**: Provides a legend for chart data series

## Testing Strategy

- **End-to-End Testing**: Use Playwright to test the complete user flow
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and hooks
- **Mock Data**: Use mock data for development and testing

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
3. Install dependencies with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Install shadcn/ui components:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add select
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add tabs
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add table
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dropdown-menu
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add sheet
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add skeleton
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add chart
```

5. Install additional dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add recharts axios date-fns react-router-dom zustand
```

6. Install Playwright for testing:

```bash
pnpm create playwright@latest
pnpm add -D @playwright/test
```

## Development Workflow

1. Start by implementing the core infrastructure (types, API client, stores, hooks)
2. Implement UI components
3. Create page components
4. Integrate with the backend API
5. Add tests

## Verification Gates

### Gate 1: Technical Validation

- All components render correctly
- Data is fetched from the API and displayed properly
- Charts display the correct data
- Filtering and sorting functionality works as expected
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- All tests pass

### Gate 2: Human Verification

- Manual testing of all features
- Visual inspection of the dashboard
- Verification of data accuracy
- Testing on different browsers and devices

### Gate 3: Understanding Validation

- Explain the component architecture
- Describe the data flow
- Explain the state management approach
- Describe the chart implementation
- Explain the testing strategy

## Questions to Consider

1. How will the dashboard handle different election types?
2. What level of detail should be shown in the initial dashboard view vs. drill-down views?
3. How can we make the dashboard intuitive for non-technical users?
4. What metrics are most important to highlight prominently?
5. How should the dashboard handle offline or degraded connectivity scenarios?

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
2. Add anomaly detection visualization
3. Implement user authentication and authorization
4. Add export functionality for reports
5. Implement internationalization support
