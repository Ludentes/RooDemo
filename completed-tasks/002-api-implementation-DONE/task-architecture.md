# Task 2: Basic API Endpoints - Architecture Document

## System Architecture Overview

The API endpoints will follow a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   API Layer     │ ← FastAPI route handlers, input validation, response formatting
├─────────────────┤
│  Service Layer  │ ← Business logic, orchestration, data transformation
├─────────────────┤
│    CRUD Layer   │ ← Database operations (already implemented in Task 1)
├─────────────────┤
│   Data Models   │ ← SQLAlchemy models (already implemented in Task 1)
└─────────────────┘
```

## Component Design

### 1. API Layer (Routes)

The API layer will be organized into logical route modules:

- **Health Routes**: System health and status information
- **Constituency Routes**: Endpoints for constituency data
- **Election Routes**: Endpoints for election data
- **Dashboard Routes**: Endpoints for dashboard summary data

Each route module will:
- Define endpoints using FastAPI decorators
- Validate request data using Pydantic schemas
- Call appropriate service functions
- Format and return responses
- Handle errors and exceptions

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer will contain business logic for:

- Data aggregation and transformation
- Cross-entity operations
- Business rule enforcement
- Error handling

Services will be organized to mirror the route structure:
- **HealthService**: System health checks and diagnostics
- **ConstituencyService**: Constituency-related operations
- **ElectionService**: Election-related operations
- **DashboardService**: Dashboard data aggregation

### 3. Dependency Injection

FastAPI's dependency injection system will be used to:
- Provide database sessions to routes
- Inject service instances
- Handle request-scoped resources
- Facilitate testing through mock dependencies

### 4. Error Handling

A centralized error handling system will:
- Catch exceptions at the API layer
- Transform exceptions into appropriate HTTP responses
- Provide consistent error formatting
- Log errors appropriately

### 5. API Documentation

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation will be automatically generated and enhanced with:
- Detailed descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Parameter explanations
- Authentication requirements (placeholder for future)

## Data Flow

### Example: Get Constituency List

1. Client sends GET request to `/api/constituencies`
2. FastAPI router validates query parameters
3. Router calls constituency service
4. Service calls CRUD operations with appropriate filters
5. CRUD layer executes database query
6. Results flow back up through the layers
7. Response is formatted and returned to client

## Technical Decisions

1. **Async/Await Pattern**
   - All endpoint handlers will be async functions
   - Database operations will use SQLAlchemy's async capabilities
   - Benefits: Better scalability and resource utilization

2. **Pagination Strategy**
   - Offset-based pagination for simplicity in this phase
   - Response will include total count, page info, and results
   - Future enhancement: cursor-based pagination for large datasets

3. **Response Envelope**
   - Consistent response structure across all endpoints
   - Will include metadata, pagination info, and data
   - Example: `{"metadata": {...}, "data": [...]}`

4. **Error Response Format**
   - Standardized error response structure
   - Will include error code, message, and details
   - Example: `{"error": {"code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "...", "details": {...}}}`

5. **CORS Configuration**
   - Allow requests from frontend origin
   - Support credentials for future authentication
   - Appropriate security headers

## API Contract

The detailed API contract will be defined in the implementation plan, but will follow these general patterns:

### Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /api/health
Response: {
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "database_connection": "ok",
  "uptime": "10h 30m"
}
```

### Constituency Endpoints
```
GET /api/constituencies
Query params: page, page_size, election_id, status
Response: {
  "metadata": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 10,
    "pages": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "District 1",
      "election_id": 1,
      "status": "active",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}

GET /api/constituencies/{id}
Response: {
  "id": 1,
  "name": "District 1",
  "election_id": 1,
  "status": "active",
  "registered_voters": 10000,
  "statistics": {...},
  ...
}
```

### Election Endpoints
```
GET /api/elections
Query params: page, page_size, status
Response: Similar to constituencies with election data

GET /api/elections/{id}
Response: Detailed election data

GET /api/elections/upcoming
Response: List of upcoming elections
```

### Dashboard Summary Endpoint
```
GET /api/dashboard/summary
Response: {
  "active_elections": 5,
  "total_constituencies": 100,
  "active_constituencies": 80,
  "recent_transactions": 1500,
  "alerts": {
    "high_priority": 2,
    "medium_priority": 5,
    "low_priority": 10
  },
  "processing_status": {
    "pending_files": 3,
    "processing_files": 1,
    "completed_files": 20,
    "failed_files": 2
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

While authentication is out of scope for this task, the architecture will be designed to easily incorporate it in the future:

- Routes will be structured to allow for auth middleware
- Dependency injection will support auth dependencies
- Response formats will accommodate auth-related metadata

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual route handlers and services
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with test database
- **Mocking**: Use dependency injection to mock services for unit tests
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum

## Simplified Architecture for Small-Scale Project

Given that this is a small single-user project, the following simplifications are recommended while maintaining good architectural practices:

1. **Simplified Health Check**: Remove CPU and memory metrics from the health check endpoint, focusing only on database connectivity and basic API status.

2. **Streamlined Service Layer**:
   - Keep the service layer pattern for separation of concerns
   - Simplify the BaseService implementation to focus on core functionality
   - Avoid over-abstraction for simple CRUD operations

3. **Focused Dashboard Summary**:
   - Start with essential metrics only
   - Add more complex aggregations only when needed

4. **Pragmatic Error Handling**:
   - Maintain the custom exception classes for clarity
   - Simplify error response format to essential fields
   - Focus on the most common error scenarios first

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extended in future tasks if needed:

1. **Authentication**: Auth middleware can be added to existing routes
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Query parameter handling can be enhanced
3. **WebSockets**: Can be added alongside REST endpoints
4. **Caching**: Can be implemented at the service layer if performance becomes an issue
5. **Rate Limiting**: Can be added as middleware if needed
