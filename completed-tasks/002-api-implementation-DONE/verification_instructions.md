# Task 2: Basic API Endpoints - Verification Instructions

## Overview

This document provides instructions for verifying the implementation of the basic API endpoints for the Election Monitoring System. The verification process follows the triple-gate control approach:

1. **Gate 1**: AI Self-Verification (Technical validation)
2. **Gate 2**: Human Verification (Manual testing and review)
3. **Gate 3**: Understanding Validation (Knowledge transfer)

> **Note**: These verification instructions have been simplified to match the scale of this small single-user project while maintaining essential quality controls.

## Gate 1: Technical Validation

### Automated Tests

All implemented endpoints must pass the following tests:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Each endpoint handler function has corresponding unit tests
   - Each service method has corresponding unit tests
   - All error scenarios are tested
   - Test coverage is at least 80%

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Each API endpoint is tested with the test database
   - Pagination and filtering functionality is verified
   - Error responses are validated

### Code Quality Checks

1. **Linting**:
   - Code passes flake8 or pylint checks
   - No unused imports or variables
   - Proper docstrings for all functions and classes

2. **Type Checking**:
   - All functions have proper type annotations
   - Type checking passes with mypy

### API Documentation

1. **OpenAPI Documentation**:
   - All endpoints are documented in Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Request/response examples are provided
   - Parameter descriptions are clear and accurate

## Gate 2: Human Verification

### Manual Testing

1. **Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Access `/api/health` and verify it returns system status
   - Check that database connection status is reported correctly

2. **Constituency Endpoints**:
   - Test listing constituencies with different page sizes
   - Test filtering by election_id and status
   - Test retrieving a specific constituency by ID
   - Verify 404 error when requesting non-existent constituency

3. **Election Endpoints**:
   - Test listing elections with pagination
   - Test filtering by status
   - Test retrieving a specific election by ID
   - Test retrieving upcoming elections
   - Verify 404 error when requesting non-existent election

4. **Dashboard Summary Endpoint**:
   - Test retrieving dashboard summary
   - Verify all required metrics are included

### Error Handling

1. **Test invalid requests**:
   - Invalid query parameters (e.g., negative page number)
   - Non-existent resources
   - Malformed requests

2. **Verify error responses**:
   - Simple, consistent error format
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Clear, human-readable error messages

### CORS Configuration

1. **Test CORS headers**:
   - Verify that CORS headers are present in responses
   - Test with different origins if possible

## Gate 3: Understanding Validation

The following questions should be answered to demonstrate understanding of the implementation:

1. **Architecture Understanding**:
   - Explain the layered architecture used in the API implementation
   - Describe the role of each layer (API, service, CRUD)
   - Explain how dependency injection is used in the implementation

2. **FastAPI Knowledge**:
   - Explain how path and query parameters are handled in FastAPI
   - Describe how Pydantic models are used for request/response validation
   - Explain how OpenAPI documentation is generated

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Describe the simplified error handling strategy implemented
   - Explain how custom exceptions are used
   - Describe how exception handlers work in FastAPI

4. **Testing Knowledge**:
   - Explain the testing strategy for the API endpoints
   - Describe how test fixtures are used
   - Explain how to test error scenarios
