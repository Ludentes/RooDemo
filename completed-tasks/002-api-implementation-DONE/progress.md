## Notes
- Task initiated on August 12, 2025
- Following systematic development workflow
- Building on completed core data models from Task 1
- Planning phase completed on August 12, 2025
- Architecture review completed on August 12, 2025
- Architecture simplified to match small single-user project scale
- Implementation completed on August 12, 2025

## Architectural Refinements
- Simplified health check endpoint (removed CPU/memory metrics)
- Streamlined dashboard summary to focus on essential metrics
- Simplified error handling approach
- Maintained good architectural practices while reducing unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Summary
1. **API Router Structure**:
   - Created router modules for health, constituencies, elections, and dashboard
   - Set up dependency injection for services
   - Configured CORS and error handling middleware

2. **Service Layer**:
   - Implemented base service with common functionality
   - Created specialized services for each domain area
   - Simplified services to match project scale

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Created custom exception classes
   - Implemented exception handlers
   - Standardized error response format

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - Implemented health check endpoint
   - Created constituency listing and detail endpoints
   - Implemented election listing, detail, and upcoming endpoints
   - Added dashboard summary endpoint

5. **Documentation**:
   - Enhanced OpenAPI documentation
   - Added detailed descriptions and examples
   - Included tag metadata

6. **Testing**:
   - Implemented unit tests for all endpoints
   - Created test fixtures and sample data
   - Set up integration testing framework

## Next Steps
- Deploy the API
- Implement frontend components that consume the API
- Add more advanced features like real-time updates
