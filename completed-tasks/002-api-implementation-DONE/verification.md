# Task 2: Basic API Endpoints - Verification

## Gate 1: AI Self-Verification

I've completed a self-verification of the implementation and can confirm:

- [x] All API router modules are properly structured and registered
- [x] Service layer is implemented with appropriate separation of concerns
- [x] Error handling framework is set up with custom exceptions and handlers
- [x] All required endpoints are implemented according to specifications
- [x] API documentation is enhanced with detailed descriptions and examples
- [x] Unit tests are implemented for all endpoints
- [x] Integration testing framework is set up

The implementation follows the simplified architecture that was designed for this small-scale project while maintaining good software engineering practices:

1. **Simplified Health Check**: Focuses on essential metrics (database connectivity, response time)
2. **Streamlined Dashboard**: Provides core statistics without unnecessary complexity
3. **Pragmatic Error Handling**: Uses a simplified but effective error response format
4. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Maintains API, Service, and CRUD layers for maintainability

All code is properly structured, follows consistent patterns, and includes appropriate documentation.

## Gate 2: Human Verification

This section requires manual verification by a human developer.

### Instructions for Human Verification

Please verify the implementation by:

1. **Running the API**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Testing the Endpoints**:
   - Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Try out the health check endpoint
   - Test the constituency endpoints
   - Test the election endpoints
   - Test the dashboard summary endpoint

3. **Verify Error Handling**:
   - Try accessing a non-existent resource (e.g., `/api/constituencies/9999`)
   - Verify that appropriate error responses are returned

4. **Run the Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m pytest tests/api
   ```

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] API starts without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns correct data
- [ ] Constituency endpoints work as expected
- [ ] Election endpoints work as expected
- [ ] Dashboard summary endpoint works as expected
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] All tests pass

## Gate 3: Understanding Validation

This section is for validating understanding of the implementation.

### Architecture Understanding

**Q1: Explain the layered architecture used in the API implementation.**

A1: The API implementation follows a layered architecture with:
- **API Layer**: FastAPI route handlers that handle HTTP requests, validate input, and format responses
- **Service Layer**: Business logic that orchestrates operations and transforms data
- **CRUD Layer**: Database operations that interact with the database
- **Data Models**: SQLAlchemy models that represent the database schema

This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable, testable, and extensible.

**Q2: Describe how dependency injection is used in the implementation.**

A2: Dependency injection is used to:
- Provide database sessions to services
- Inject service instances into route handlers
- Make testing easier by allowing dependencies to be mocked

FastAPI's dependency injection system is used with the `Depends` function to inject dependencies into route handlers.

### Error Handling

**Q3: Describe the error handling strategy implemented.**

A3: The error handling strategy uses:
- Custom exception classes that extend FastAPI's HTTPException
- Exception handlers that transform exceptions into standardized responses
- A simplified error response format with a clear error message

This approach ensures consistent error handling across the API and provides clear error messages to clients.

### Testing Approach

**Q4: Explain the testing strategy for the API endpoints.**

A4: The testing strategy includes:
- Unit tests for each endpoint using pytest and FastAPI's TestClient
- Test fixtures that set up test data and database sessions
- Integration tests that test the API as a whole
- Tests for both success and error scenarios

The tests use an in-memory SQLite database to ensure isolation and fast execution.
