# API Implementation Summary

## Task Overview
This task involved implementing the core API endpoints for the Election Monitoring System, including health check, elections, constituencies, and dashboard endpoints. The implementation follows a layered architecture with CRUD operations, service layer, and API routers.

## Implemented Features

### API Endpoints
- **Health Check**: `GET /api/health` - Returns system health status
- **Elections**:
  - `GET /api/elections` - List all elections with pagination and filtering
  - `GET /api/elections/{election_id}` - Get election details
  - `GET /api/elections/upcoming` - List upcoming elections
- **Constituencies**:
  - `GET /api/constituencies` - List all constituencies with pagination and filtering
  - `GET /api/constituencies/{constituency_id}` - Get constituency details
- **Dashboard**:
  - `GET /api/dashboard/summary` - Get system-wide metrics and statistics

### Database Management
- Created seed script to populate the database with sample data
- Created clear script to reset the database
- Added documentation for database management

### Documentation
- Updated API contracts documentation to match implementation
- Updated data model documentation to reflect actual database models

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Repository Pattern**: CRUD classes for database operations
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation
- **API Routers**: FastAPI endpoint definitions
- **Dependency Injection**: For database sessions and services

### Key Components
- **BaseService**: Common service functionality
- **BaseCRUD**: Common database operations
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses
- **Response Format**: Consistent API response structure

## Challenges and Solutions

### Database Connection Issues
- **Challenge**: Health check endpoint reported "unhealthy" due to database connection errors
- **Solution**: Updated to use synchronous database API and added detailed logging

### CRUD Operations
- **Challenge**: Missing db parameter in CRUD method calls
- **Solution**: Updated BaseService to correctly pass the db parameter

### Pagination
- **Challenge**: Missing pagination support in get_upcoming_elections method
- **Solution**: Added pagination parameters and logic to the method

### Response Format
- **Challenge**: Inconsistencies between model schemas and service responses
- **Solution**: Standardized response format across all endpoints

## Future Improvements
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement remaining endpoints (alerts, transactions)
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Enhance error handling with more specific error codes
- Add comprehensive logging throughout the application
