# Task 2: Basic API Endpoints Implementation

## Objective
Implement the foundational API endpoints that will serve as the interface between the frontend and backend systems, leveraging the core data models created in Task 1.

## Background
With the core data models now implemented, we need to create the basic API endpoints that will allow the frontend to interact with these models. These endpoints will form the foundation of our application's communication layer and will be expanded upon in later tasks.

## Scope

### In Scope
1. **Health Check Endpoint**
   - Implement a simple health check endpoint to verify API availability
   - Include basic system status information

2. **Constituency Endpoints**
   - Create endpoint to list all constituencies with filtering and pagination
   - Implement endpoint to retrieve detailed information for a specific constituency

3. **Election Endpoints**
   - Create endpoint to list all elections with filtering options
   - Implement endpoint to retrieve detailed information for a specific election
   - Create endpoint to retrieve upcoming elections

4. **Dashboard Summary Endpoint**
   - Implement endpoint that provides summary statistics for the dashboard
   - Include counts of active elections, constituencies, and recent transactions

5. **API Documentation**
   - Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all implemented endpoints
   - Include request/response examples and parameter descriptions

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implement consistent error handling middleware
   - Create standardized error response format
   - Handle common error scenarios (not found, validation errors, server errors)

7. **CORS Configuration**
   - Set up CORS middleware to allow frontend access
   - Configure appropriate security headers

### Out of Scope
- Authentication and authorization (will be addressed in a future task)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
- Transaction and alert-specific endpoints (will be addressed in later tasks)
- Performance optimization (will be addressed in a later task)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
2. All endpoints follow RESTful API design principles
3. All endpoints are documented with Swagger/OpenAPI
4. All endpoints include proper input validation
5. Error responses follow a consistent format
6. CORS is properly configured to allow frontend access
7. Health check endpoint returns system status information
8. Constituency listing endpoint supports pagination and basic filtering
9. Election endpoints provide all necessary data for frontend display
10. Dashboard summary endpoint aggregates key metrics
11. All endpoints have corresponding unit tests with at least 80% coverage
12. API documentation is accessible via /docs endpoint

## Technical Constraints

1. Use FastAPI for API implementation
2. Leverage Pydantic schemas from Task 1 for request/response validation
3. Use dependency injection for database access
4. Follow the project's error handling conventions
5. Implement proper logging for all endpoints
6. Ensure all endpoints are testable with pytest
7. Use async/await for database operations

## Dependencies

1. Core data models (completed in Task 1)
2. Database access layer (completed in Task 1)
3. Pydantic schemas (completed in Task 1)

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours

## Resources
- FastAPI documentation: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
- Pydantic documentation: https://docs.pydantic.dev/
- Project's developer guidelines

## Task Completion Checklist
- [ ] Health check endpoint implemented and tested
- [ ] Constituency endpoints implemented and tested

## Notes
- Focus on creating a clean, consistent API design that can be extended in future tasks
- Ensure proper error handling and validation to provide clear feedback to API consumers
- Consider the needs of the frontend when designing response structures
