# Triple-Gate Control: Human-Centric Verification

## Gate Definitions

### Gate 1: AI Self-Verification (Automated)
**Purpose**: Catch obvious technical issues before human review
**Performed by**: AI assistant automatically

**AI Checklist**:
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Type checking passes (if applicable)
- [ ] No undefined variables or functions  
- [ ] Required dependencies imported
- [ ] Basic logical consistency check
- [ ] Follows project formatting standards

**AI Reports**: "‚úÖ Gate 1 Self-Check Complete - Basic validation passed"

### Gate 2: Mandatory Human Verification (Manual)
**Purpose**: Ensure human actively engages with implementation
**Performed by**: Human developer (cannot be delegated)

**Universal Requirements**:
- [ ] Actually run/execute the code manually
- [ ] Inspect the output/behavior with your own eyes
- [ ] Review the code changes line by line
- [ ] Confirm it does what it's supposed to do

**Context-Specific Requirements**:

**For New Features**:
- [ ] Test the feature manually in the application
- [ ] Verify integration with existing functionality
- [ ] Test with different input scenarios

**For Bug Fixes**:
- [ ] Reproduce the original bug scenario  
- [ ] Confirm the fix resolves the issue
- [ ] Test that fix doesn't break other functionality

**For APIs**:
- [ ] Test endpoints with actual HTTP requests
- [ ] Verify response formats and status codes
- [ ] Check error handling with invalid inputs

**Human Confirms**: "‚úÖ Gate 2 Verified - I have personally tested this implementation"

### Gate 3: Understanding Validation (Quiz)
**Purpose**: Ensure developer comprehends the implementation
**Performed by**: Human answers, AI evaluates

**Standard Quiz Questions**:
1. "Explain the key technical decisions made and why"
2. "What would happen if [edge case scenario]?"
3. "How would you modify this for [different requirement]?"
4. "What are the potential failure points and how are they handled?"

**Scoring**: 80%+ understanding required to pass

## Verification Enforcement

### After Code Generation, AI MUST:
1. **STOP immediately** - no explanations or next steps
2. **Present verification checkpoint** in exact format
3. **Wait for "verified" confirmation** - accept no shortcuts
4. **Refuse to continue** until proper verification confirmed

### Required Checkpoint Format:
```
üõë **GATE 2 VERIFICATION REQUIRED** üõë

I've generated code for: [FEATURE/TASK NAME]

**‚úÖ Gate 1 (AI Self-Check): PASSED**
- Code compiles without errors
- Basic validation complete

**‚è≥ Gate 2 (Human Verification): PENDING YOUR ACTION**

You must now personally verify this implementation:
- [ ] Run/execute the code manually
- [ ] Inspect output with your own eyes
- [ ] Review code changes line by line
- [ ] [Context-specific requirements]

**üö® I CANNOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU CONFIRM VERIFICATION üö®**

Type "verified" once you have personally completed all verification steps.
```

### Acceptable Verification Confirmations:
- "verified"
- "verification complete"  
- "I have tested this manually and it works"
- "Gate 2 verified - tested personally"

### Unacceptable Responses (require proper verification):
- "looks good"
- "continue"
- "tests pass"
- "seems fine"
- "approved"

## NEVER proceed to Gate 3 or next tasks without explicit verification confirmation
